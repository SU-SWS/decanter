// Atoms
//
// Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces,
// atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.
// Atoms can also include more abstract elements like color palettes,
// fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.
// Like atoms in nature they’re fairly abstract and often not terribly useful on
// their own. However, they’re good as a reference in the context of a pattern
// library as you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.

// Molecules
//
// Things start getting more interesting and tangible when we start combining
// atoms together. Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the
// smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own
// properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.
// For example, a form label, input or button aren’t too useful by themselves,
// but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something
// together.

// Organisims
//
// Molecules give us some building blocks to work with, and we can now combine
// them together to form organisms. Organisms are groups of molecules joined
// together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
// We’re starting to get increasingly concrete. A client might not be terribly
// interested in the molecules of a design system, but with organisms we can see
// the final interface beginning to take shape. Dan Mall (who I’m working with
// on several projects) uses element collages, which articulate ideas for a few
// key organisms to facilitate client conversations and shape the visual
// direction (all without having to construct full comps).
// Organisms can consist of similar and/or different molecule types.
// For example, a masthead organism might consist of diverse components like a
// logo, primary navigation, search form, and list of social media channels.
// But a “product grid” organism might consist of the same molecule (possibly
// containing a product image, product title and price) repeated over and over
// again. Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating
// standalone, portable, reusable components.

// Variables
//
// Variables are a way to store information that will be reused throughout a
// project. They store things like colors and fonts, or any CSS value that'll be
// reused.
// Every variable is declared as !default so that it can be
// overridden by a previous import.
// If you want to override a variable, set that variable in one of your
// own partials, then @import '{path/to/}core/variables'.
//
// Style guide: Variables

// Load order convention exception
//
// The convention for importing files in index.scss files
// is to import in alphabetical order. This file
// intentionally breaks that convetion, as core variables
// need to be imported before all others.

@import
  'core/index',
  'components/index',
  'elements/index';

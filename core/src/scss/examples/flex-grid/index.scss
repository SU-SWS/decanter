// Flexbox Grid System
//
// While the available Flexbox grid system still remains a class-based system, the class names have changed and are processed dynamically, using a combination of new functions and mixins. These can be found /core/src/scss/utilities/functions/flex/ and /core/src/scss/utilities/mixins/flex, respectively.
// For example, grid--6-of-12 is now flex-6-of-12.
//
// Weight: -70

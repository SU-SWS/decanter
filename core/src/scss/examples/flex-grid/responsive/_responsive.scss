// Responsive Classes
//
// The grid includes five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.
// You can customize the size of your columns (or items inside of your columns) on small, medium, large, extra large, or extra extra large devices.
// For grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use
// the <code class="kss-code">.flex-*-of-*</code> and <code class="kss-code">.flex-*-*-of-*</code> classes. Specify a numbered class when you need a
// particularly sized column; otherwise, feel free to stick to <code class="kss-code">.flex-*-of-*</code> .
//
// For example, if you wanted to produce a layout that would span two of the available twelve columns,
// you would do the following:
//
// Markup: ../../../../../templates/examples/flex-grid/responsive/responsive.twig
//
// Weight: -100
//
// Style guide: Examples.Flex-Grid.Responsive

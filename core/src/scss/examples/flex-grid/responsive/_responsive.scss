// Responsive Classes
//
// The grid includes five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.
// You can customize the size of your columns (or items inside of your columns) on small, medium, large, extra large, or extra extra large devices.
// For grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use
// the .flex-*-of-*and .flex-*-*-of-*classes. Specify a numbered class when you need a
// particularly sized column; otherwise, feel free to stick to .flex-*-of-*.
// For example, if you want to produce a layout where a column spans
// two of the available twelve columns at every breakpoint, you would do the following: class="flex-2-of-12".
// If you wanted to produce a layout that would span two of the available twelve columns,
// you would do the following:

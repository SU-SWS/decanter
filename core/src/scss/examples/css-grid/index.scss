// CSS Grid System
//
// The CSS Grid system is a grid-based layout system handles the both rows and columns
// simultaneously. In comparison to the Flexbox Grid system, which is strictly single-dimension
// alignment and linear, the CSS Grid system supports two dimension alignment aka
// arbitrary two-dimenasional positioning. Similar to the Flexbox Grid system,
// the CSS Grid system also incoporates Mixins.
//
// For example, with the Flexbox Grid system, you can only make an single item align to
// either the row or column. If you would like to control both, it would require you to nest
// the item within two seperate divs. However, with the CSS Grid system, you can have the item
// positioned simultaneously for row and column while having it all nested within a singular div.
//
// In the example below, we used the <a href="http://localhost:9000/section-layout.html#kssref-layout-flex-3column-bars">
// Three Columns layout called Bars</a> for the CSS Grid system.

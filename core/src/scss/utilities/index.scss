/// Variables
//
/// Variables are a way to store information that will be reused throughout a
/// project. They store things like colors and fonts, or any CSS value that'll be
/// reused.
/// Every variable is declared as !default so that it can be
/// overridden by a previous import.
/// If you want to override a variable, set that variable in one of your
/// own partials, then @import '{path/to/}core/variables'.

/// Functions
//
/// Programmatic procedure or routine to help making writing code or declaring
/// something easier and more seamless.

//
/// Mixins
//
/// Mixins help with things that are a bit tedious to write in CSS (e.g.,
/// vendor prefixes that exist). Mixins allow for making groups of CSS
/// declarations for reuse throughout a project. Mixins can even pass in values
/// to make things more flexible.

//
/// Placeholders
//
/// Placeholders are reusable blocks of base CSS styles that can be used to reduce repetitiveness
/// by using `@extend %placeholder;`.
/// Placeholder styles do not show up in the compiled CSS file until a selector extends them.

/// Load order convention exception
//
/// The convention for importing files in index.scss files is to import in
/// alphabetical order. This file intentionally breaks that convention, as
/// variables need to be imported before functions and mixins.

@import
'variables/index', /// Needs to be before mixins.
'functions/index',
'mixins/index',
'placeholders/index';

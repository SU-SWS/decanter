/// To be used for long form text, most importantly for your wysiwyg body style.
/// The purpose of this style is to allow for longer lengths of text to be easily readable for a user from a comfortable distance from their screens. With a deliberately larger font-size and open line height we’re able to service this display requirement, allowing for users to track from one line to another without incurring fatigue. This style can also be used for other purposes, but note that it’s open line height can make for an awkward display if used in the wrong places.

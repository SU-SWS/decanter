// Variables
//
// Variables are a way to store information that will be reused throughout a
// project. They store things like colors and fonts, or any CSS value that'll be
// reused.
// Every variable is declared as !default so that it can be
// overridden by a previous import.
// If you want to override a variable, set that variable in one of your
// own partials, then @import '{path/to/}core/variables'.

//
// Mixins
//
// Mixins help with things that are a bit tedious to write in CSS (e.g.,
// vendor prefixes that exist). Mixins allow for making groups of CSS
// declarations for reuse throughout a project. Mixins can even pass in values
// to make things more flexible.

// Load order convention exception
//
// The convention for importing files in index.scss files is to import in
// alphabetical order. This file intentionally breaks that convetion, as
// variables need to be imported before functions and mixins.

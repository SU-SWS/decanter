# Decanter

Welcome to the Decanter Style Guide and Pattern Library.

Decanter is an artifact (and tool) of the design and development system that
while aligned with a single product line, has a chief goal of housing patterns
that can be used in any project. It is also a browsable collection of design
patterns that have been vetted and translated into code.

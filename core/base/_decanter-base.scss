/// Base rules consist of styling for HTML elements only, such as used in a CSS

/// To avoid ‘undoing’ styles in components, base styles should reflect the
/// simplest possible appearance of each element. For example, the simplest usage
/// of the ul element may be completely unstyled, removing list markers and
/// indents and relying on a component class for other applications.

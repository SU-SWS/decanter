// 4. COMPONENTS
// For small components, there is the `components/` folder.
// While `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe),
// `components/` is more focused on widgets. It should all
// kind of specific modules like a sliders, loaders, widgets,
// and basically anything along those lines.
//
// There are usually a lot of files in components/
// since the whole site/application should be mostly
// composed of tiny modules.

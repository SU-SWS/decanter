# FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DECANTER

You can use this directory to quickly test your templates/markup/styles.

## Setup

1. Create a new templates file called test.twig in this directory
2. Create a new json file called test.json in this directory with at least an empty object `{}`
3. Compile the assets by running `npm run dev`
4. Start the webserver by running `npm run start`
5. Optionally run `npm run watch` to live compile the assets.
